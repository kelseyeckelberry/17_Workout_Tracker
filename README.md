# Unit 17 Homework: Workout Tracker

## Description
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, this app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour! button. When the user clicks it, the burger moves to the right side of the page. This app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
